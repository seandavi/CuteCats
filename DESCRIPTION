Description: The CuteCats package has incredible functionality. There are
    advanced machine learning and artificial methods for determining if a 
    user is a cat lover or not. Note that we do not attempt to provide 
    measures of uncertainty since there is really no uncertainty about 
    whether a person is a cat lover or not. In addition, there are state-
    of-the-art image manipulation methods that actually display the output
    after manipulation. The image displays are also incredibly valuable and
    have been shown to actually enhance mood of the user.
