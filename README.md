## The CuteCats Package

### Overview

The CuteCats package has incredible functionality. There are advanced
machine learning and artificial methods for determining if a user is 
a cat lover or not. Note that we do not attempt to provide measures of
uncertainty since there is really no uncertainty about whether a person
is a cat lover or not. In addition, there are state- of-the-art image
manipulation methods that display the output after manipulation. The 
image displays are also incredibly valuable and have been shown to 
enhance mood of the user.
